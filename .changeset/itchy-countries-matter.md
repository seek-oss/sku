'sku': patch
---

Change internal handling of the `sku` config.

This has resulted in a slight change to the output of the eslint file.
This file is generated by sku so no changes are needed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using `dangerouslySetESLintConfig` to change your eslint config it will only work if the option is set in a `sku.config.[ts|js|mjs]` file.
> Custom config paths that set `dangerouslySetESLintConfig` will have no effect on the resolved eslint config.
