Fixes a bug that caused React 19 applications to fail during `sku build`

Note: remaining on React 18 is recommended until `sku` officially supports React 19. Updating your application to React 19 may require overriding dependency versions by configuring your package manager. Additionally, there may be other incompatibilities that haven't been found yet.
