Change the CLI to commander.js.

**BREAKING CHANGE**

`sku` now uses [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) for its CLI. The CLI options and commands are now more narrowly defined and scoped. Some combinations of options that were previously possible may no longer work.

The new `-h, --help` flag now shows the help output generated by commander.js and shows the available commands and options.

The following option flags are now available in their respective scope

#### Global options

- the `-e, --environment` option
- the `-c, --config` option
- the `-d, --debug` option
- __new:__ the `-h, --help` option
- __new:__ the `-v, --version` option

#### Scoped options

- the `build`, `build-ssr`, `start`, and `start-ssr` commands have the following options
  - `-s, --stats` option

  - `--port` option
