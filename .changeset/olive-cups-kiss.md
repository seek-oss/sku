Change the CLI to commander.js.

**BREAKING CHANGE**

SKU now uses [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) for its CLI. The CLI options and commands are now more narrowly defined and scoped. Some combinations of options that were previously unintended may no longer work.

The new `-h, --help` flag now shows the help output generated by commander.js and shows the available commands and options.
