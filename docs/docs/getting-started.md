# Getting Started

Create a new project and start a local development environment:

```bash
$ pnpm dlx @sku-lib/create my-app
$ cd my-app
$ pnpm start
```

Or create in the current directory:

```bash
$ pnpm dlx @sku-lib/create .
$ pnpm start
```

By default, a new project's dependencies will be installed using the package manager it was run with.
