Front-end development toolkit, powered by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), [Less](http://lesscss.org/), [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

Quickly get up and running with a zero-config development environment, or optionally add minimal config when needed.
Designed for usage with [braid-design-system](https://github.com/seek-oss/braid-design-system), although this isn't a requirement.

This tool is heavily inspired by other work, most notably:

- [facebookincubator/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- [insin/nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb)
- [NYTimes/kyt](https://github.com/NYTimes/kyt)

> [!WARNING]
> While this software is open source, its primary purpose is to improve consistency, cross-team collaboration and code quality at SEEK.
> As a result, it’s likely that this tool may not exactly suit your needs, or may be overkill for your use case.
> It may be worth considering alternatives such as [Vite] or [Parcel].

## Getting Started

Create a new project and start a local development environment:

```sh
$ npx sku init my-app
$ cd my-app
$ yarn start
```

By default, a new project's dependencies will be installed with the first supported package manager detected on your system.
Package managers are detected in the following order: `yarn` -> `pnpm` -> `npm`.
This can be overridden via the `--packageManager` flag:

```sh
$ pnpm dlx sku init --packageManager pnpm my-app
$ cd my-app
$ pnpm start
```
